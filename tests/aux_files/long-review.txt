Movie Review: Shadows Beneath the Neon Sky

Every once in a while, a film arrives that resists easy categorization. Shadows Beneath the Neon Sky, the sophomore effort from director Eliza Morante, is precisely that kind of film: a hybrid of neo-noir mystery, character study, and fractured romance that thrives in its contradictions. It is as stylish as it is melancholic, as playful in its form as it is devastating in its subject matter.

The story, on the surface, seems simple. Julian Vega (played with remarkable restraint by Tomás Herrera) is a burnt-out sound engineer living in a sprawling metropolis bathed in perpetual neon light. One night, while cleaning an old tape machine, he discovers a series of mysterious recordings that hint at a murder never solved. Drawn in by the voice of the woman on the tapes—an aspiring jazz singer named Lila, portrayed by newcomer Anika Cho—Julian embarks on a journey that blurs the line between detective work and obsession.

Morante, who earned critical recognition for her debut indie drama Orbits of Dust, shows a remarkable command of atmosphere here. The city itself is a character: rain-slick streets glimmer like oil paintings, subway stations echo with the hum of unseen machines, and high-rise windows glow like constellations. Yet, despite the allure of its visual palette, the film never fetishizes the city. Instead, it paints urban life as both alluring and suffocating, a place where dreams echo loudly but often fade into static.

The film’s pacing is deliberate, sometimes even glacial. Scenes linger on details others would cut: Julian rewinding a tape for the fifth time, a neon sign sputtering into darkness, Lila adjusting her microphone before singing a half-finished ballad. To some viewers, this may feel indulgent. But these pauses allow the story to breathe, drawing us into Julian’s fragmented perception. The longer we sit with these moments, the more they reveal: the fragility of memory, the ache of loneliness, the danger of confusing fascination with connection.

Performance-wise, Herrera carries the film with a quiet magnetism. His Julian is no hard-boiled detective; he is a weary man desperate for meaning, someone who projects his longing onto the mystery he stumbles into. Cho, meanwhile, delivers a breakout performance. Though she appears mostly in recordings and dreamlike flashbacks, she infuses Lila with both vulnerability and defiance. Even in fragmented glimpses, her presence is haunting. Their relationship—imagined, remembered, or real—becomes the film’s emotional core.

Technically, Shadows Beneath the Neon Sky is immaculate. The sound design, appropriately, plays a starring role. Morante uses layered audio—snippets of tape hiss, muffled street noise, jazz riffs bleeding from basement bars—to place us inside Julian’s head. The score by Mateo Klein oscillates between moody synth waves and sparse piano, amplifying the tension between the futuristic and the intimate. Cinematographer Lucia Park frames every shot with precision: reflections in puddles, hallways collapsing into vanishing points, faces illuminated by a flickering television. It’s visual poetry without becoming self-parody.

That said, the film is not without flaws. Its third act, in which Julian uncovers the truth behind the recordings, veers toward melodrama. The climactic reveal feels somewhat conventional compared to the elliptical storytelling that precedes it. A subplot involving corrupt city officials and real estate speculation seems shoehorned, distracting from the central dynamic between Julian and Lila’s memory. At nearly two and a half hours, the film occasionally overstays its welcome, and some viewers may find themselves wishing for a sharper edit.

Still, imperfections aside, Shadows Beneath the Neon Sky lingers long after the credits roll. It is not a film for everyone—it demands patience, attention, and a willingness to embrace ambiguity. But for those attuned to its wavelength, it is a deeply rewarding experience: a meditation on memory, desire, and the illusions we project onto others. Morante cements herself as one of the most intriguing voices in contemporary cinema, and this haunting, neon-soaked dreamscape is proof of her audacity.

Verdict: 8.5/10 – A hypnotic, flawed, but unforgettable exploration of obsession and longing.
